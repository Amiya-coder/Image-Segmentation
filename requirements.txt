* OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for real-time computer vision.
* NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
* The os module provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
* The Frangi filter is used to detect tubular structures in images, part of the scikit-image library.
* Scikit-image morphology module includes operations on binary images such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and structuring elements.
* Skeletonization reduces binary objects to 1-pixel wide representations.
