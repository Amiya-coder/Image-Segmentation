# Fundus Image Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains tools and scripts for segmenting blood vessels in fundus images using basic image processing techniques. The primary focus is to aid in the diagnosis of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension by providing an automated method to extract blood vessels without the use of machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- **Blood Vessel Extraction**: Implements simple point operations and image filtering techniques to segment blood vessels from the background and other retinal structures.
- **Dice Score Evaluation**: Includes a method to calculate the Dice coefficient, providing a quantitative measure of the segmentation accuracy against ground truth annotations.
